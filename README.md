This repository contains a collection of basic Python programs written by me as I learn and practice Python fundamentals. Inside, you will find beginner-friendly examples covering variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries, problem-solving scripts, and other small practice exercises.

The purpose of this repo is to document my Python learning journey, help me understand core concepts through hands-on coding, and provide a simple reference for anyone who is also starting with Python.

To use the code, you can browse through the files, clone the repository, and run any Python script using the command python filename.py. Although this is mainly a personal practice space, suggestions and improvements are always welcome.
